    <h3>The OSI model is a conceptual standard for visualizing the 7 layers computer networking communication.<br> Unlike Dante's 7 layers, network administrators can easily identify and troubleshoot network issues by followiing the standard from bottom to top.</h3>

    <P>The OSI model helps network technicians and administrators to visualize the flow of traffic across a netowrk, identify 
        where problems may arise, and provides a framework for categorizing different components of a network.
        The OSI model can be further divided into three sections, as shown in the image above. Layers 5-7 are known as the software layes. 
        Layer 4 is the layer involved in creating and disconnecting sessions between two machines on a network. 
        The hardware that creates a network can be placed in layes 1-3. Not everything to do with networking will always fit neatly
        into a specific layer. This is meant to be used as a general framework to aid in visualization and troubleshooting.

    <h2>Here is a good mnemonic for remembering the seven layers:</h2>
    <ol type = "1">
        <li>Please</li>
        <li>Do</li>
        <li>Not</li>
        <li>Throw</li>
        <li>Sausage</li>
        <li>Pizza</li>
        <li>Away</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>If you don't like sausage pizza:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Please</li>
        <li>Do</li>
        <li>Not</li>
        <li>Touch</li>
        <li>Steve's</li>
        <li>Pen...</li>
        <li>Again</li>
    </ul>
